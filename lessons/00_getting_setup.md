# 00 Getting Setup

## Installation

Before the first lesson you will need to get [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) installed.

VS Code is my favorite text editor but is completely optional. If you prefer Atom, Sublime Text or VIM, feel free to use those instead.
